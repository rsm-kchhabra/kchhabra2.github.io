Statistical Replication and Interpretation of Karlan &amp; List
(2007)</strong></h1>
<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>This report provides an in-depth replication and interpretation of
the statistical methodologies and findings from the seminal field
experiment conducted by Karlan and List (2007), titled "Does Price
Matter in Charitable Giving?" The paper examines how matching grant
offers influence both the likelihood of charitable donations and the
amount given. Our analysis uses the original experimental data to
explore the efficacy of various match ratios and donor responses.
Through a combination of econometric analysis and simulation, we
replicate the key statistical insights and reflect on their implications
for fundraising and behavioral economics.</p>
<h2 id="balance-test"><strong>1. Balance Test</strong></h2>
<p>Before assessing treatment effects, we evaluate the quality of the
randomization by comparing observable characteristics across the
treatment and control groups. One key pre-treatment variable analyzed is
mrm2, which captures the months since a donor last contributed to the
organization.</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>We performed a two-sided t-test comparing the means of mrm2 for
treatment versus control.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, we conducted a simple linear regression: mrm2 ~
treatment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="media/image4.png"
style="width:5.52962in;height:3.27604in" /></p>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The mean difference in mrm2 was small and statistically
insignificant.</p></li>
<li><p>The OLS regression yielded a near-zero coefficient on the
treatment indicator.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This confirms that randomization
achieved balance across groups on this important dimension. The lack of
statistically significant differences implies that any subsequent
differences in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment rather than
pre-existing disparities. This is consistent with Table 1 of the
original study, which serves as a critical validity check.</p>
<h2 id="effect-of-matched-donations-on-donation-probability"><strong>2.
Effect of Matched Donations on Donation Probability</strong></h2>
<h3 id="visual-analysis"><strong>Visual Analysis:</strong></h3>
<p>A bar plot comparing the proportion of individuals who donated in the
treatment group versus the control group reveals a clear visual increase
in the likelihood of giving when a match offer is present.</p>
<p><img src="media/image3.png"
style="width:5.18229in;height:3.67831in" /></p>
<p><strong>Graph Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The control group has a lower donation rate, confirming that
individuals not presented with a matching offer are less inclined to
give.</p></li>
<li><p>The treatment group displays a notable uplift, providing visual
affirmation of the intervention's impact.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="statistical-analysis"><strong>Statistical
Analysis:</strong></h3>
<p>To formally test the effect, we conducted:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A two-sample t-test of donation rates ("gave" variable).</p></li>
<li><p>A linear probability model (OLS regression): gave ~
treatment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The t-test yields a statistically significant result, with
treatment increasing the probability of giving.</p></li>
<li><p>The regression coefficient is positive and significant,
quantitatively supporting the same conclusion.<br />
<img src="media/image6.png"
style="width:6.26772in;height:4.36111in" /></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> These findings underscore the
behavioral power of framing. Offering a matching grant, even without
specifying the match size, effectively boosts engagement. Donors likely
interpret matching as a signal of collective efficacy or organizational
credibility, prompting greater participation.</p>
<h3 id="probit-model"><strong>Probit Model:</strong></h3>
<p>We also estimate a probit regression of gave ~ treatment, mirroring
the approach in Table 3, Column 1.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The probit results confirm that the
marginal effect of treatment remains positive and significant even under
a non-linear specification. This reinforces the robustness of the main
effect and strengthens our confidence in its generalizability.</p>
<p><img src="media/image2.png"
style="width:6.26772in;height:2.63889in" /></p>
<h2 id="effect-of-match-ratio-size"><strong>3. Effect of Match Ratio
Size</strong></h2>
<h3 id="pairwise-t-tests"><strong>Pairwise T-tests:</strong></h3>
<p>We test whether larger match ratios lead to increased giving by
comparing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1:1 vs 2:1</p></li>
<li><p>2:1 vs 3:1</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="media/image7.png"
style="width:6.19792in;height:2.59104in" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>No statistically significant differences in response rates are
detected between these match conditions.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="regression-analysis"><strong>Regression Analysis:</strong></h3>
<p>We estimate a regression: gave ~ C(ratio) to examine if match ratios
have a differential effect on giving.</p>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The coefficients on 2:1 and 3:1 matches are not statistically
different from the baseline 1:1 match.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This suggests that the marginal
return on increasing the match ratio is effectively zero. The presence
of a match appears sufficient to generate psychological salience. Beyond
that, larger incentives may not enhance perceived value or urgency. This
is a key behavioral insight that challenges traditional economic models
of price sensitivity.</p>
<h3 id="manual-difference-calculations"><strong>Manual Difference
Calculations:</strong></h3>
<p>Using group means, we directly computed the differences in donation
rates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2:1 vs 1:1: negligible</p></li>
<li><p>3:1 vs 2:1: negligible</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> These values corroborate our
regression findings. They indicate that once the concept of matching is
introduced, the specific multiple does not meaningfully alter donor
behavior. This implies diminishing psychological returns to increasing
match ratios.</p>
<h2 id="donation-amounts"><strong>4. Donation Amounts</strong></h2>
<h3 id="full-sample-regression"><strong>Full Sample
Regression:</strong></h3>
<p>We regressed total donation amount on treatment status for the entire
sample.</p>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The average donation is slightly higher in the treatment group,
though this difference is modest and varies in statistical
significance.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="media/image8.png"
style="width:6.26772in;height:6.83333in" /></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="conditional-on-donation"><strong>Conditional on
Donation:</strong></h3>
<p>Restricting the sample to individuals who made a donation (gave ==
1), we re-estimated the regression.</p>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>No significant difference in average donation size was
observed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The treatment's effectiveness lies
primarily in increasing the participation rate rather than altering the
generosity of existing donors. This insight is crucial for organizations
aiming to expand their donor base.</p>
<h3 id="histograms"><strong>Histograms:</strong></h3>
<p>We plotted donation amounts for donors in treatment and control
groups.</p>
<p><img src="media/image1.png"
style="width:6.26772in;height:2.51389in" /></p>
<p><strong>Graph Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both distributions are right-skewed, reflecting a typical
long-tail pattern in giving.</p></li>
<li><p>The sample means, indicated by vertical lines, are nearly
identical.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> These plots visually confirm that
conditional giving behavior remains stable across groups. Behavioral
change occurs primarily at the extensive margin (whether to give) rather
than the intensive margin (how much to give).</p>

<h2 id="simulation-analysis"><strong>5. Simulation
Analysis</strong></h2>
<h3 id="law-of-large-numbers-lln"><strong>Law of Large Numbers
(LLN):</strong></h3>
<p>We simulated 10,000 draws from control (p = 0.018) and treatment (p =
0.022) distributions and plotted the cumulative mean difference.</p>
<p><img src="media/image5.png"
style="width:6.26772in;height:4.59722in" /></p>
<p><strong>Graph Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The cumulative average converges to the true population
difference of 0.004.</p></li>
<li><p>This convergence illustrates the principle that sample means
become reliable with sufficient data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This simulation reinforces the
trustworthiness of experimental outcomes derived from large samples. The
LLN ensures that our results are not driven by chance.</p>
<h3 id="section-5"></h3>
<h3 id="section-6"></h3>
<h3 id="central-limit-theorem-clt"><strong>Central Limit Theorem
(CLT):</strong></h3>
<p>We simulated distributions of sample mean differences at sizes 50,
200, 500, and 1000.</p>
<p><img src="media/image9.png"
style="width:6.26772in;height:5.02778in" /></p>
<p><strong>Graph Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution becomes
more concentrated and bell-shaped.</p></li>
<li><p>The distributions center around the expected value (0.004), and
their variance decreases.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This exercise demonstrates the CLT
in action, underscoring the role of sample size in determining
statistical power and inference reliability. It justifies the paper's
use of large-scale field experimentation.</p>
<h2 id="section-7"></h2>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Our replication confirms the main findings of Karlan and List
(2007):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The presence of a matching grant significantly increases donation
rates.</p></li>
<li><p>The size of the match offer has little to no additional
effect.</p></li>
<li><p>The treatment primarily affects the extensive margin (whether to
donate), not the intensive margin (how much to donate).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These results have meaningful implications for fundraising
strategies. From a behavioral economics perspective, matching offers
serve more as psychological signals than economic incentives.
Fundraisers may benefit more from framing and visibility of matching
rather than adjusting match magnitudes.</p>
<p>The robustness of these findings, confirmed through both classical
inference and simulation, highlights the value of well-designed field
experiments in revealing the underlying drivers of economic
behavior.</p>
